# Waiter-Tips-Prediction-Model

Just Built a Machine Learning Web App: Waiter Tip Prediction System!
Today, I’m excited to share a full end-to-end ML project I recently completed — from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model… all the way to deploying a complete Flask web application with HTML/CSS frontend.

This project predicts how much tip a customer will likely give based on:
💵 Total Bill
👤 Customer Gender
🚬 Smoker or Non-Smoker
📅 Day of the Week
⏱️ Lunch or Dinner
👥 Party Size

I trained the model in Google Colab using Linear Regression, applied feature encoding, evaluated it with R², MAE, RMSE, and finally exported the model using Joblib.

Then I built a clean and responsive Flask web interface where users can enter inputs and instantly get a prediction.
The app is fully functional, lightweight, and perfect for demonstrating ML deployment skills.

Tech Stack:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Flask
HTML & CSS
Joblib Model Serialization
🎯 What I learned:
Data preprocessing & encoding
Model training & evaluation
Saving ML models using Joblib
Flask backend development
Building a user-friendly frontend
Deploying ML models as web apps
